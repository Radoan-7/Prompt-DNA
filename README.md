## ⚡ Overview
**Prompt DNA** is a next-gen AI visualization tool that decodes the *“genetic makeup”* of prompts.  
Built during the **Maximally PromptStorm Hackathon**, it turns plain text into a living, breathing visualization of your creative process.  

🌀 _Because every great AI output starts with a spark of human imagination._

⚡ **Real-time Visualization** – Watch your prompt evolve into dynamic DNA strands powered by animation.  
🧠 **Insight Mode** – Analyze which parts of your prompt contribute most to creativity or chaos.  
🎭 **Custom Themes** – Electric blue, neon yellow, and black — matching the Maximally “storm energy.”  
🌩️ **Interactive Animations** – React-powered motion effects for every input.
